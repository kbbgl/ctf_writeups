# `Buffer Overflow 3`


## Description

Do you think you can bypass the protection and get the flag?

It looks like Dr. Oswal added a stack canary to [this program](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/492/vuln) to protect against buffer overflows. 

You can view [source here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/492/vuln.c). 

And connect with it using:

```bash
nc saturn.picoctf.net 57427
```

## Research

There's no validation whether `length` variable is supposed to be an integer or not so we can insert any string that is 64 characters long.

```c
#define BUFSIZE 64
char length[BUFSIZE];

printf("How Many Bytes will You Write Into the Buffer?\n> ");
   while (x<BUFSIZE) {
      read(0,length+x,1);
      if (length[x]=='\n') break;
      x++;
   }
   sscanf(length,"%d",&count);
```
