Hey, how do you decrypt this file again?
You're serious?
Yeah, I'm serious
openssl des3 -d -salt -in file.des3 -out file.txt -k supersecretpassword123
Ok, great, thanks.
Let's use Discord next time, it's more secure.
C'mon, no one knows we use this program like this!
Whatever.
Hey.
Yeah?
Could you transfer the file to me again?
Oh great. Ok, over 9002?
Yeah, listening.
Sent it
Got it.
You're unbelievable
